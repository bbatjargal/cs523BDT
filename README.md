# cs523BDT
cs523 Big Data Technology Final Project.

## Describe
The basic idea of the project is to get data from twitter, deal with it with spark stream, proceed some simple analysis, then store the result to hive, then extract data and group by using spark SQL. Finally, visualization the final result with Plotly dynamically.

### Part 1
We use spark streaming to get data from kafka continuously on batch interval 10s. Also, the spark streaming are used to parse data and simple statistics, such as the statistics of lang, hashtags and source, which mean the platform people used to tweet.
### Part 2
As spark streaming deal with real-time data, we use hive and spark to store and analysis the history result of spark streaming.
### Part 3
In part 2, spark SQL will generate some statistics result on a period of time, we use the Plotly visualize the spark SQL result, including the count of lang, hashtags, source and the hashtags trend every minute.
### Part 4
In part 1, we use kafka to produce twitter's real-time streaming data and let spark streaming to consume it.

## Environment

All the development work is done on Ubuntu 16.04. We use zookepper, kafka, spark, hive, plotly to integrate the whole project, which all are running under pseudo mode. The main program is written by python.
Installation records: Docs/records.md

### Requirments
- Anaconda2(python 2.7.14)
- Zookeeper 3.4.5
- Kafka 2.11-1.0.0
- Spark 1.6.0
- Plotly 2.5.0

## How it work
Firstly, you need to be sure all the components are correctly installed and started, mainly focus on kafka and hive.

### Get the data
Under the project directory, run the getData.py script:
``` 
$ python Codes/getData.py
```
This script will use twitter real-time streaming API to get real-time tweets, the filter condition is set to "AI". It will proceed the tweets into kafka while writing to a local .json file.

If you're offline, you also can use a tweets file to generate data in Kafka. For example, we already have a .json file in Data directory as tweets_AI.json, use the order to push the data to Kafka:
```
$ cat Data/tweets_AI.json | $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic tweets
```
### The main programe
The main program sparkKafka.py need to initialize by spark:
```
$  $SPARK_HOME/spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-streaming-kafka-0â€“8_2.11:1.6.0 Codes/sparkKafka.py
```
When it's running, it gets data from kafka and parse data to count hashtags, you will see some simple result in the terminal window. Since the spark streaming batch interval is set to 10s, the interval analysis result is stored to hive for further analysis. In the mean time, we extract data from hive and proceed further analysis using spark SQL, then visualizing the final result by Plotly. In our main program, the spark SQL will analysis the history data, and update the data visualization every 10s with the latest data.
